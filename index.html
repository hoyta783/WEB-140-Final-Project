    All you got to do is change the area in the img sections, and also over in the javascript
    Everything is ready, just switch the nasa pictures with your graphics and it should work perfectly :) -->

                <p class="idk">Many nurses work in hospitals, helping doctors with sick patients, working to provide the best service they can for every patient in the hospital they can help. Some nurses choose instead to go into residential homes of elderly or disabled people. In residential homes, the nurses are often given more control over how the patients are cared for, and often have less patients than nurses working at a hospital. Others may even choose to go into the military as nurses, work in schools, or even just helping with research into pharmaceutics.</p>
